# Troubleshooting

If you're having a problem with Brimcap, please browse the following sections

# Gathering Info

Before [opening an issue](#opening-an-issue), or while debugging a
previously-opened issue, there's detail you can gather that may help us more
quickly provide you with a resolution.

## Sensitive Information (important!)

For all information described in this section, we understand that some of it
may be of a sensitive nature such that you don't feel you can attach it
directly to a public GitHub Issue. If you can crop, blur, or otherwise modify
the information before attaching, please do. If you feel you could share such
information only privately, please notify us on [public Slack](https://www.brimsecurity.com/join-slack/)
and we can arrange to receive it from you in a private 1-on-1 chat.

## Screenshots/Videos

If you think you've encountered a bug that's specific to how Brimcap interacts
with the Brim app, a screenshot or recorded desktop video of your Brim app
that includes the error message or unexpected behavior may help us a lot. If
you can annotate your media with arrows, text, or other detail, even better.
The same is true if you're submitting a detailed feature request.

## Sample Packet Captures

If your problem involes a pcap file, we'll likely be able to debug much quicker
if you can attach a sample pcap file to your issue. If you are able to
reproduce the issue using a small pcap that you're certain does not contain
sensitive information, that would be ideal.

## Large Files

If you have a video or sample pcap that is too large to attach to a GitHub
Issue, please upload it to the file-sharing service of your choosing and paste
a link to it in your issue.

# Opening an Issue

Before/when [opening a new issue](https://github.com/brimdata/brimcap/issues/new/choose),
you can help us out by doing the following:

* Browse the existing [open issues](https://github.com/brimdata/brimcap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen). If you confirm you're hitting one of those, please add a comment to it rather than opening a new issue.
* [Gather info](#gathering-info) that that may help in reproducing the issue and testing a fix, and attach it to your issue.
* Feel free to chat with the team on the [public Slack](https://www.brimsecurity.com/join-slack/) before/after opening an issue.
* When you open a new issue, its initial text will include a template with standard info that will almost always be needed. Please include detail for all areas of the template.

Thanks for helping us support the Brim community!
